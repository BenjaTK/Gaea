Gaea is an **add-on for Godot 4**, designed to empower your project with advanced **procedural generation** capabilities.

> **NOTE:** Gaea is currently in early development, and may not yet be optimized for larger, more complex projects. Stay tuned for ongoing improvements and enhancements!

### What's in a Name?

**Gaea**, in Greek mythology, is the personification of Earth - a nod towards the terrain and world generation capabilities this addon brings to your game development toolkit. Plus, we think it sounds pretty cool.

# 💫 Key Features

## Generators
Our collection of generators, including Cellular, Heightmap, and Walker, allow for dynamic and unique world creation. Whether you're looking to create intricate cave systems or sprawling landscapes, Gaea's got you covered.
