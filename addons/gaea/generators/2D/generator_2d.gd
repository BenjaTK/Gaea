## Sets the generator to be used for the next pass. This generates a new grid on top of the one
## generated by this one.[br][br]
## If you're using a [GaeaRenderer], set its [param generator] to the last generator in the chain.[br]
## If you're using a [ChunkLoader2D], set its [param generator] to the first one.[br][br]
## [b]Note:[/b] Using modifiers instead of multiple generators is recommended. Only chain generators if necessary.
